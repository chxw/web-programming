<h1>Security Assessment</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/">https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/</a> is a simple server ride-hailing API. POST /rides inserts a passenger's information to server database -- requires username, lat, and lng values. POST /update inserts a vehicle's information to server database -- requires username, lat, lng values. GET /passenger.json requires "username=value" query and displays passengers with username of value. GET /vehicle.json requires "username=value" query and displays vehicles with username of value. GET / displays all entries in passengers database orderd by creation time. </p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>Using the OWASP Top 10, test for the top 10 Web Application Security Risks in <a href="https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/">https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/</a>.</p>

<p>Tools used include Burp Suite Community Edition v2020.5.1 and FoxyProxy.</p>

<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
<p>This server is vulnerable to attackers accessing sensitive information from restricted databases and excessive requests spamming the database with junk information.</p>

<h2>Issues Found<h2>
	<h3>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h3>
	<p>Attackers are able to abuse POST /rides by injecting javascript into username value. </p>

	<p><strong>Location</strong></p> <code> POST /rides </code>

	<p><strong>Severity of issue</strong></p>
	<p>High severity, entire website can be co-opted by attackers -- as seen with this lab.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Proof of vulnerability</strong></p>
	<img src="XSS.png" alt="Cross-Site Scripting attacks">

	<p><strong>Resolution</strong></p>
	<p> Filter input on arrival. Encode data on output. Use appropriate response headers for HTTP responses that aren't inteneded to contain any HTML or JavaScript (i.e. use <code>Content-Type</code> and <code>X-Content-Type-Options</code> headers to ensure that browsers interpret the response the way you intend. As a last line of defense, Content Security Policy.</p>

	<h3>Database leakage</h3>
	<p>Since the accepted vehicle usernames are hardcoded in the source code, if an attacker is able to access the usernames, they are able to gain access to vehicles database.</p>

	<p><code>var vehicles = ["JANET","NgfcWZmS", "tNEh59TC", "suFKyeZg", "VMerzMH8", "6tWDkKh6", "ajNnfhJj", "bCxY6mCw", "Cq4NX9eE", "mXfkjrFw", "EMYaM9D8", "nZXB8ZHz", "Tkwu74WC", "TnA763WN", "TaR8XyMe", "5KWpnAJN", "uf5ZrXYw"];</code></p>

	<p><strong>Location</strong></p> <code> POST /UPDATE </code>

	<p><strong>Severity of issue</strong></p>
	<p> High severity if source code is vulnerable, i.e. pushed to github</p>

	<p><strong>Proof of vulnerability</strong></p>
	<img src="access-vehicles.png" alt="Access vehicles database information via hardcoded vehicle usernames">

	<p><strong>Resolution</strong></p>
	<p> Store accepted vehicle usernames in environment variables from <code>.env</code> file.</p>

	<h3>No Authentication</h3>
	<p>The routes with <code>response.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");</code> are vulnerable to attackers writing a script and sending a ton of junk requests with fake data to spam the database.</p>

	<p><strong>Location</strong></p> <code> POST /rides, POST /update </code>

	<p><strong>Severity of issue</strong></p>
	<p> High severity -- database can be co-opted by attackers.</p>

	<p><strong>Proof of vulnerability</strong></p>
	<img src="spam.png" alt="Spam requests">

	<p><strong>Resolution</strong></p>
	<p> Route middleware from a number of packages that offer this. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This server should implement <code>.env</code> files, route middleware for authentication, and sanitize user input data. Additionally, this server suffers from insufficient logging. </p>
