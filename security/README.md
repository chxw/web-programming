## Reflection:
I was able to identify 3 security and privacy issues with the ride-hailing service API. I saw that others in the course were able to perform XSS attacks, but I was unable to successfully execute these, though I tried. See below for attempted XSS and SQL injection attacks I tried to perform using the Burp suite.

![XSS](1)
![Encoded XSS](2)
![SQL injection](3)
![SQL injection](4)
![XSS](5)


I spent 5 hours working on this lab. No collaboration or discussion with others on this assignment.
